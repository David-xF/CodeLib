# Information
You can set your ASM_PATH in the MAKEFILE to the path of your .asm File so you don't always have to replace it manually.

If any Button Checks don't Work, you might have the Wrong Input Settings set, please check if your `Emulated Controller` is set to `Wii U Gamepad` as it is required.
