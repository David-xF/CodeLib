# Building
You need to have [`devkitPro`](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) Installed. After that You can build this with the Command `make all`.

# Information
You can set your `ASM_PATH` in the `Makefile` to the path of your .asm File so you don't always have to replace it manually.

If any Button Checks don't Work, you might have the Wrong Input Settings set, please check if your `Emulated Controller` is set to `Wii U Gamepad` as it is required.
