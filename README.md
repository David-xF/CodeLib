# Building
You need to have [`devkitPro`](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) Installed. After that You can build this with the Command `make all`.

After building your Graphics Pack is finished and can be found at `./GraphicPack`. Insert this Folder into your `Cemu/graphicPacks` Folder and Start Cemu. After starting Cemu go to `Options -> Graphic packs`.
There you will find your Graphis Pack which you can then Enable or Disable. `Enable/Disable it Before Starting Minecraft!`

# Information
You can set your `ASM_PATH` in the `Makefile` to the path of your .asm File so you don't always have to replace it manually.

If any Button Checks don't Work, you might have the Wrong Input Settings set, please check if your `Emulated Controller` is set to `Wii U Gamepad` as it is required.
